            "Birds call in the distance, light rain trickles onto the forest floor around you. In front of you, just out of the rain, is an old and weathered hat. You can almost feel a strange sense of warmth emanating from it, pulling you closer, pleading for you to investigate further.",
            "You sit up and take a look inside the hat. Gently placed in the centre of the inner lining of the hat, is a silver coin, the morning sunlight glistening off the surface. Hesitantly, you reach into the hat and grab the coin; it's cold and dry, untouched by the rain. ",
            "You place it in your shirt pocket for safekeeping, but when you look back into the hat, another coin, nigh identical to the one you had just picked up, is exactly where the previous one was. You check your shirt pocket to make sure it's a different coin, and sure enough, the one in your pocket hasn't disappeared."
